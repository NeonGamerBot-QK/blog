When i was on vacation i was bored in a car so i thought it would be pretty fun to have apple maps send my data to zeon which resulted in seeing like 50% of the correct data!!
Well so uh, i coded a bot to parse it lol.

## So uh how does it work

Well it works via me texting the email bot.

Well how is the email bot reciving texts if its for emails??

> i use mms :D

## What is MMS

MMS is text to email so emails can text back with media as well!
MMS plays a key role in this code as i would have no other way to recive the messages ~~unless i paid for twilo~~

## How does the code actually work, stop giving bloat

So this code watches the email and when it recives a text matching the janky way apple sends it.
It compiles an epic json file with all the data sorted correctly.
This data can be used for an epik UI which could be added in the future, but its mainly just to track for now.

## Conclusion

this was a pretty fun project!. i hope to improve it with a UI or smthing else in the future.
