## Announcment post
![Announcment post](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/6a625c52fdf1e5b4f61bdc213a9d49c03bf23868_image.png)
When a new ysws comes out in hackclub they are announced on the #annoucnemts channel. this was the post and i was like oh yay a new ysws is out!
Then i saw it is favored in *TS* and *JS* and i was really happy because im really experince and good with javascript and typescript. the post also said the ws (we ship) part of it was the orpheus pico (microcontroller simillar to rpi pico) and i was very excited to obtain that!



## Project idea
The YS (You ship) part of this ysws was a npm package would not be hard at ALL for me so i picked up a name on npm i was hogging and made a package out of it. The NPM package is `puppeteer-http-server` which combines a puppeteer server and a express server together to make a simple way to use puppeteer in a server. This project didnt take super long to finish and i had it done pretty fast.
Here is what it looked like:

## Submission
After i had submitted i was very happy and got approved! 
Eventually after a while i got a package with the orpheus pico and a few other things. 
I was excited to see the puppeteer-http-server package and i was happy to see it was approved.


## Conclusion
I really liked this ysws and the ysws's lux ran after has been going great!
