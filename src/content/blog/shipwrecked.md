# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked, one of the first island hackathons which had over **$129k** spent on the event and around **~70k** spent on the island.

Now, how did i get to here, well first i had to do the pre requisties for this which was spending over _60h_ coding and shipping 4 projects which are up to 15hr
