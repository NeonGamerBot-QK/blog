# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked, one of the first island hackathons which had over **$129k** spent on the event and around **~70k** spent on the island.

Now, how did i get to here, well first i had to do the pre requisties for this which was spending over _60h_ coding and shipping 4 projects which are up to 15hr each! There was also a virality requirement which was dropped originally which was most likely due to the fact there were to little users who went viral for the event. There was also a travel stipend option which was after the 60h each hour would count for 10$, (10$/hr).

## The Bay Projects

little showcase of my 4 main projects

### My site

I had a site and i had felt like redoing it over the summer so i re did it and logged all the hours. You can see the finished product [here](https://saahild.com) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/saahild.com)

### Signal app

Have you ever wanted to use the signal desktop but on the web?
Well i worked on a project for doing that! it didnt really work well and its a major wip but one day it will get finished!
You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/signal-app)
_i also tried to get this to go viral but only got up to 27 gh stars as of today_

### Fintrack
Fin track was a tool which was also a major wip which would pull data from your github.
You can see the code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/fintrack)
### Telegram HWF

I had built a telegram bot which worked simillar to the how we feel app and implemented 90% of the features onto that bot.
It is mostly finished and you can try it out [here](http://t.me/howwefeel00bot) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/telegram-hwf)

## The island
Once i gained all the neccary hours by doing the 4 required projects above and 2 measly side projects to gain some extra hours for my stipend which i ended up getting all the hours i needed to get a return stipend!



### Day 1
<!-- image here or smt (prob the people sitting on the mat) -->

The first day is the day i made i had landed in boston and basically i had went to the meeting spot which was just some spot outside a hotel (see above). Then in the evening they had started loading people onto the ferry, once we had made it to the island we had some freetime before we had to attend the Opening ceramony! At the opening ceromany we learned about the first challange and what we would need to code for that, i then formed a team with my roomate and we both locked in and made this: Frame by Frame [demo](https://framebyframe-eight.vercel.app/) - [Repo](https://github.com/jleuth/framebyframe). We worked on that project for most of the night and then submitted it the next day. Here is a photo of the ferry we went on as well!

The second day had come and i woke up on time and got breakfest, and then continued to explore and chat with other people on the island and particpate in other activites and then later that evening we had finally shipped our project as it mostly worked..., then after everyone had shipped the second challange had been released, once again me and my roomated cooked up this amazing project which was.... gambling! i had worked on the backend + db for linking it with the shipwrecked database while my teamate worked on the front end in the morning of day 3 (fun fact i was asleep all morning) . The formal name of our project was Shipwrecked gambaling and you can test it [here](https://shipwrecked-gamble.saahild.com/) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/shipwrecked-gambling).

### Day 3
<!-- i KNOW you have the sunrise today -->
![Sunrise photo taken from inside my dorm](/images/shipwrecked/sunrise_1.jpg)

_fun fact i took that sunrise photo and then passed out on my bed_

This day we had fully finished the project and submitted it and then for the last challange we speedran this as it was an easy project and we vibecoded this and finished this by the end of the day and then i spent the rest of the day doing other challanges, i mostly just chilled for that day and spent lots of the day and night roaming the island :).


### Day 4
<!-- sunrise of this day + smt else ig -->

When i had woken up i had just focused on packing up since i woke up like 10 mins before they were kicking us out of the dorm rooms :P, i had then went and presented/shared the last project with my teamate and then the rest of the day i spent wrapping up with friends and talking to people! Then they started sending us back on ferries and then we were free till then! i had my flight the next day so i spent some time with friends roaming boston and went to the public library and then dropped my stuff off at the hostel. Then later in the night i went with 2 organizers for some icecream and went around in the subway with them (see image below).

### HM: Fruddles
<!-- fruddle image -->
![Fruddle selfie](/images/shipwrecked/fruddle.jpg)

During the nights between the hours of like 2am-4am i had particpated in something called fruddles. Now what is a fruddle? a fruddle is a fraud huddle (huddles are like the calls but for slack) and basically this was like an irl fruddle which we fraud checked people for a diffrent event called [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com) or some other people / were testing some fraud stuff. I cannot go into the method we use to detect fraud as that would just benefit fraudsters.

## Conclusion
Shipwrecked from the start sounded like a great event and it lived up to its expectiations till the end, you can ask anyone who went to the event there experince and they would gladly tell you about it! I think all the organizers did a great job and overall I liked this event a lot and cannot wait to attend another hackclub event like this one day!
