# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked, one of the first island hackathons, had over **$129k** spent on the event and around **~70k** spent on the island.

Now, how did I get here? Well, first I had to do the prerequisites for this, which included spending over *60h* coding and shipping 4 projects, each up to 15 hours long! There was also a virality requirement which was dropped originally, most likely because too few people went viral for the event. There was also a travel stipend option: after the 60h, each hour would count for $10 (10$/hr).

## The Bay Projects

A little showcase of my 4 main projects:

### My site

I had a site and felt like redoing it over the summer, so I redid it and logged all the hours. You can see the finished product [here](https://saahild.com) and the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/saahild.com).

### Signal app

Have you ever wanted to use the Signal desktop app on the web?
Well, I worked on a project for doing that! It didn’t really work well and it’s a major WIP, but one day it will get finished!
You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/signal-app).
*I also tried to get this to go viral but only got up to 27 GitHub stars as of today.*

### Fintrack

Fintrack was a tool (also a major WIP) which would pull data from your GitHub.
You can see the code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/fintrack).

### Telegram HWF

I built a Telegram bot which worked similarly to the *How We Feel* app and implemented 90% of the features onto that bot.
It’s mostly finished and you can try it out [here](http://t.me/howwefeel00bot) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/telegram-hwf).

## The island

Once I gained all the necessary hours by doing the 4 required projects above and 2 small side projects, I ended up with enough hours to get a full return stipend!

### Day 1

![Mat with hackers on it](/images/shipwrecked/mat.jpeg)
The first day I landed in Boston and went to the meeting spot, which was just some spot outside a hotel (see above). In the evening they started loading people onto the ferry. Once we got to the island, we had some free time before attending the Opening Ceremony! At the ceremony we learned about the first challenge and what we would need to code for it. I then formed a team with my roommate, and we both locked in and made this: Frame by Frame [demo](https://framebyframe-eight.vercel.app/) - [Repo](https://github.com/jleuth/framebyframe). We worked on that project for most of the night and submitted it the next day. Here’s a photo of the ferry we went on!

### Day 2

On the second day I woke up on time, got breakfast, and then continued to explore, chat with other people on the island, and participate in other activities. Later that evening we shipped our project (it mostly worked…). Then the second challenge was released. Once again, my roommate and I cooked up this amazing project which was… gambling! I worked on the backend + DB to link it with the Shipwrecked database, while my teammate worked on the front end the next morning (fun fact: I was asleep all morning). The formal name of our project was *Shipwrecked Gambling* and you can test it [here](https://shipwrecked-gamble.saahild.com/) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/NeonGamerBot-QK/shipwrecked-gambling).

### Day 3

*fun fact: I took that sunrise photo and then passed out on my bed*

This day we fully finished the project and submitted it. For the last challenge we speedran it, since it was easy, and finished by the end of the day. After that I spent most of the day doing other challenges, chilling, and roaming the island :).

### Day 4

When I woke up, I focused on packing since I woke up like 10 minutes before they were kicking us out of the dorm rooms :P. I then went and presented/shared the last project with my teammate, and spent the rest of the day wrapping up with friends and talking to people! Then they started sending us back on ferries and we were free until then! My flight was the next day, so I spent some time with friends roaming Boston, visited the public library, and then dropped my stuff off at the hostel. Later that night I went with 2 organizers for ice cream and explored the subway with them (see image below).

### HM: Fruddles

During the nights between 2am–4am I participated in something called Fruddles. Now, what is a Fruddle? A Fruddle is a *fraud huddle* (huddles are like calls but for Slack). Basically this was like an IRL Fruddle where we fraud-checked people for a different event called [Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com), or tested some fraud stuff. I can’t go into detail about the methods we use to detect fraud as that would just benefit fraudsters.

## Conclusion

Shipwrecked from the start sounded like a great event, and it lived up to its expectations until the end. You can ask anyone who went to the event about their experience and they’d gladly tell you! I think all the organizers did a great job and overall I liked this event a lot. I can’t wait to attend another Hack Club event like this one day!
