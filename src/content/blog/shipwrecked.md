# Shipwrecked

Shipwrecked, one of the first island hackathons which had over **$129k** spent on the event and around **~70k** spent on the island.

Now, how did i get to here, well first i had to do the pre requisties for this which was spending over _60h_ coding and shipping 4 projects which are up to 15hr each! There was also a virality requirement which was dropped originally which was most likely due to the fact there were to little users who went viral for the event. There was also a travel stipend option which was after the 60h each hour would count for 10$, (10$/hr).
